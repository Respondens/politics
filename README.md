# Political trends in Europe

This code is part of an investigation into long term political trends in Europe by De Correspondent.

## Aim of the project

The aim of this project is to find the big trends in the European political landscape by using data sources commonly used by political scientists, but not by journalists. 

Many people seem to have the feeling that the political landscape is changing rapidly in Europe (and beyond) and that far right parties are gaining ground. In stead of looking at separate elections, we try to get a bird's eye view.

This is work in progress and you're invited to tag along and drop us a line. You can reach us at reinier at decorrespondent.nl, or dimitri at decorrespondent.nl

## Data sources

An important source is the [ParlGov database](http://www.parlgov.org/) from Holger DÃ¶ring and Philip Manow of the University of Bremen.

You will find a collection of csv files of ParlGov in the [data folder.](https://github.com/Respondens/politics/tree/master/data/source_data).

We'll add more data sources as we go.
